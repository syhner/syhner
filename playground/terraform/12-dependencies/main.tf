# Most of the time, Terraform infers dependencies between resources based on the configuration given, so that resources are created and destroyed in the correct order. Occasionally, however, Terraform cannot infer dependencies between different parts of your infrastructure, and you will need to create an explicit dependency with the depends_on argument.

# Sometimes there are dependencies between resources that are not visible to Terraform, however. The depends_on argument is accepted by any resource or module block and accepts a list of resources to create explicit dependencies for.
