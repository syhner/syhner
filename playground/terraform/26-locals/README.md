# Learn Terraform locals

This repo is a companion repo to the [Learn Terraform locals](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/locals) tutorial.

Terraform locals allow you to simplify your Terraform configuration and avoid
repetition. Local values can also help you write more readable configuration by
using meaningful names rather than hard-coding values.
